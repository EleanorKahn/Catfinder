## Catfinder

# Goal
The overall goal of this project is to build and deploy a site that will enable users to search for adoptable cats in their area, and to provide a bit of info on why adoption is the better option. My technical goals were to improve my design skills through copy work and to gain more experience working with REST APIs and Tailwindcss.

# What I used 
This project uses the React.js library, Tailwindcss with postcss and autoprefixer, and the Petfinder API. It also uses the Sunnyside design challenge from Frontend Mentor for inspiration (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef). 

# Personal note
I am a huge cat lover, and a fierce advocate for adoption. The Petfinder site (https://www.petfinder.com/) is a really incredibly resource that allows people who are looking for animal companions to find animals that need homes. It is a truly unique resource because it allows shelters to provide a ton of data on each animal, so people can find the animal who is right for them. On a more personal note, I found my cat through Petfinder, and I could not be more grateful to them for allowing me to find her. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
