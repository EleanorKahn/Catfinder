# Catfinder

## Purpose
To build and deploy a site that will enable users to search for adoptable cats in their area

## What I used 
- Create React App
- React 18.2.0
- react router dom 6.11.1
- tailwindcss 3.3.2
- postcss-cli 10.1.0
- autoprefixer 10.4.14
- petfinder API 
- Frontend Mentor design inspo

This project uses the React.js library, Tailwindcss with postcss and autoprefixer, and the Petfinder API. It also uses the Sunnyside design challenge from Frontend Mentor for inspiration (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef). 

# Personal note
I am a huge cat lover, and a fierce advocate for adoption. The Petfinder site (https://www.petfinder.com/) is a really incredible resource that allows people who are looking for animal companions to find animals that need homes.
